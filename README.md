# Is your banana ripe?

## Goal
Funny story, I have been living my life without realizing that I am color deficient in seeing the color green. This creates some problems when navigating the world, specifically getting groceries like fruits. Therefore, this project serves to help people like me, who are color deficient in green, to be able to do specific tasks like identifying whether a banana is ripe or not. 

As a data science major, I'm interested in using this goal to combine with my data science skills to create a deep learning model that could classify whether or not a banana is ripe or not. 

## Tools
• Image processing: cv2, imghdr
  
• Deep learning framework: Tensorflow, Keras

• Image visualization: Matplotlib
  

## Result
• Created a CNN model that has a 95% accuracy of predicting a banana's ripeness
• Visualized the loss and accuracy of the model and determined that it is not overfitting

## Limitation
• Because this model has a 95% accuracy level, there's definitely room for improvement in optimizing
the accuracy level and loss level to reach the 100% accuracy and 0% loss level

## Citation
• All of the images used in training this model are taken from Google Images
